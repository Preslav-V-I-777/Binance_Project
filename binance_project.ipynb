    "This project is dedicated to collecting accurate price and timestamp data from Binance using both the REST API and Websocket. the goal is to build a reliable data pipeline that extracts raw market data, transforms it into a clean and usable format, loads it into the appropriate storage layers, and ultimately analyzes it to uncover insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain clarity and structure throughout the development process, the documentation and codebase will be organized into four main sections: data extraction, data transformation, data loading, and data analysis. Each section will detail the methods, tools, and design choices involved, creating a clear end-to-end overview of the entire workflow."
